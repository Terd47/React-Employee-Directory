# React-Employee-Directory 
This application enables the user (company director or management) to view non sensitive information about employees of the company and gives him/her the ability to search or sort results based on firstname, lastname, city, years with the company. It also displays an image of each employee for easy identification.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
